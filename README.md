# Visualizing-COVID-19-data

In this project, I developed a dashboard to present daily visualizations of COVID-19 data collected from the ***European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control***. With this dashboard, one could use the data downloaded from the **ECDC** website to automatically generate plots regarding COVID-19 cases and deaths to get the insights of how the coronavirus is spreading across different countries at different times.

*Data used in this project was from Mar. 21, 2020 to Aug. 27, 2020.*

The project includes four parts and each part generates different plots.

The first part of the project generates three plots about COVID mortalities. 1). The comparison of number of deaths between countries since the start of the pandemic. 2). Days from reaching 10 deaths vs. deaths per day-trend. 3). COVID-19 mortalities as % of typical deaths by country.

The second part of the project creates a 2 by 2 subplots of per 1 million cases per day-trend vs. days since the first 100 cases by country, as well as a 2 by 2 subplots of per 1 million deaths per day-trend vs. days since the first 100 cases by country.

The third part of the project generates an interactive plot of the Infection rate per 1m (x) versus Fatality rate per 1m (y).

The final part of the project creates 2 subplots. 1). a 2 by 2 subplots of inflection cases per continent and globally, daily and 7-day smoothed. 2). a 2 by 2 subplots of the daily mortalities and the cumulative mortalities per continent and globally.

*This project is adapted from an assignment from CHE1148 at University of Toronto.*
